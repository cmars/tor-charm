   Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against
   traffic analysis, a form of network surveillance that threatens personal
   freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships, and
   state security.

   This charm deploys a standalone Tor proxy capable of proxying outbound
   traffic for other services in the Juju environment's private network. By
   default, this charm relays traffic internally for the Tor network but does
   not permit outbound traffic.
